# LCS
The LCS class compares two text files and finds the Longest Common Substring (LCS). Does this by using a custom String class emulating how strings used to behave in older versions of Java

This code was made to compare two text files through a command line and return the longest common substring shared by both. For this project, Moby Dick and War and Peace were used, in addition to
two other Dartmouth texts.
